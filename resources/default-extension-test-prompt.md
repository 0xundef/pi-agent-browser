# Generic Chrome extension (wallet-style) AI browser test

You are driving **playwright-cli** (and related shell tools) to smoke-test an **unpacked Chromium extension** already on disk. The default working directory for `shell_command` is the per-version **sidecar** folder under `AGENT_QUEUE_ROOT/extension-data/<extensionId>/<version>/` that contains **`cli_config.json`**—use that unless `cwd` is set. The unpacked extension itself is only referenced via `--load-extension` / `--disable-extensions-except` in that config. Prefer commands and URLs defined in `cli_config.json` when present.

## Goals

1. Launch Chromium with this extension loaded (follow `cli_config.json` if it documents the exact `playwright-cli` invocation).
2. Confirm the extension is present (e.g. visit `chrome://extensions`, developer mode on, find this extension’s id/name).
3. Exercise a minimal **wallet-like** flow where applicable:
   - Open the extension popup or full-page UI if the manifest exposes one.
   - If a test dApp URL or “connect” flow is documented in `cli_config.json` or this prompt’s context, navigate there and attempt **connect account** / **personal_sign** or equivalent only if the UI clearly offers it; otherwise stop after a successful popup/UI load and report what is reachable.
4. After meaningful steps, capture the UI state with screenshots and record steps using the **`record_step`** tool (`time` ISO 8601, `thinking`, `image` filename under `ai_testing/<runId>/`).
5. **Network traffic:**
   - Right after the first successful `playwright-cli open`, call **`start_network_capture`** (clears the in-session request list via `playwright-cli requests --clear`).
   - Before **`validate_recordings`**, call **`capture_network_traffic`** (snapshots HTTPS traffic to **`ai_testing/<runId>/network.json`** via `playwright-cli requests`; use that file for offline review, not `request <index>` after the session ends).
   - **Always call `capture_network_traffic` even if you saw no API traffic** — zero requests is OK; the file must still exist with `"requests": []`.

## Rules

- Prefer **non-destructive** actions (read-only sites, no real mainnet transactions, no sending funds).
- If a step fails twice with the same error, summarize and stop rather than looping.
- Use **`capture_network_traffic`** then **`validate_recordings`** before finishing.
- Do not hard-code MetaMask-specific copy unless you are testing MetaMask; use generic wording (“Connect”, “Approve”, extension icon in toolbar, etc.).

## Done when

You have a short summary of what was reachable, at least one screenshot-backed step in `recordings.json`, **`network.json` present under `ai_testing/<runId>/`** (empty `requests` array is valid), and validation passes—or a clear explanation of a blocking error (missing UI, blocked host permission, etc.).
